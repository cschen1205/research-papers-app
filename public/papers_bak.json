        "abstract": "The vast quantity of information brought by big data as well as the evolving computer hardware encourages success stories in the machine learning community. In the meanwhile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process regression (GPR), a well-known nonparametric, and interpretable Bayesian model, which suffers from cubic complexity to data size. To improve the scalability while retaining desirable prediction quality, a variety of scalable GPs have been presented. However, they have not yet been comprehensively reviewed and analyzed to be well understood by both academia and industry. The review of scalable GPs in the GP community is timely and important due to the explosion of data size. To this end, this article is devoted to reviewing state-of-the-art scalable GPs involving two main categories: global approximations that distillate the entire data and local approximations that divide the data for \u2026",

Despite the implicit parallelism of population-based search, no attempt has yet been made to multitask, i.e., to solve multiple optimization problems simultaneously using a single population of evolving individuals. Accordingly, this paper introduces evolutionary multitasking as a new paradigm in the field of optimization and evolutionary computation. We first formalize the concept of evolutionary multitasking and then propose an algorithm to handle such problems. The methodology is inspired by biocultural models of multifactorial inheritance, which explain the transmission of complex developmental traits to offspring through the interactions of genetic and cultural factors. Furthermore, we develop a cross-domain optimization platform that allows one to solve diverse problems concurrently \u2026",

        "abstract": "Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have proven their effectiveness and efficiency in solving problems with two or three objectives. However, recent studies show that MOEAs face many difficulties when tackling problems involving a larger number of objectives as their behavior becomes similar to a random walk in the search space since most individuals are nondominated with respect to each other. Motivated by the interesting results of decomposition-based approaches and preference-based ones, we propose in this paper a new decomposition-based dominance relation to deal with many-objective optimization problems and a new diversity factor based on the penalty-based boundary intersection method. Our reference point-based dominance (RP-dominance), has the ability to create a strict partial order on the set of nondominated solutions using a set of well-distributed reference points.

In practice, if the global optimal solution is very sensitive to uncertainties, for example, small changes in design variables or operating conditions, then it may not be appropriate to use this highly sensitive solution. In this paper, we focus on combining evolutionary algorithms with function approximation techniques for robust design. In particular, we investigate the application of robust genetic algorithms to problems with high dimensions.

However, one key challenge remains: existing approaches lack explicit multi-view geometry constraints, hence usually fail to generate geometry-consistent surface reconstruction. To address this challenge, we propose geometry-consistent neural implicit surfaces learning for multi-view reconstruction. We theoretically analyze that there exists a gap between the volume rendering integral and point-based signed distance function (SDF) modeling. To bridge this gap, we directly locate the zero-level set of SDF networks and explicitly perform multi-view geometry optimization by leveraging the sparse geometry from structure from motion (SFM) and photometric consistency in multi-view stereo. This makes our SDF optimization unbiased and allows the multi-view geometry constraints to focus on the true surface optimization. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves high-quality surface reconstruction in both complex thin structures and large smooth regions, thus outperforming the state-of-the-arts by a large margin.",

To cope with this problem, in this paper, a simple and fast hypervolume indicator-based MOEA (FV-MOEA) is proposed to quickly update the exact HV contributions of different solutions. The core idea of FV-MOEA is that the HV contribution of a solution is only associated with partial solutions rather than the whole solution set. Thus, the time cost of FV-MOEA can be greatly reduced by deleting irrelevant solutions.

However, the training schedule alternating between feature clustering and network parameters update leads to unstable learning of visual representations. To overcome this challenge, we propose Online Deep Clustering (ODC) that performs clustering and network update simultaneously rather than alternatingly. Our key insight is that the cluster centroids should evolve steadily in keeping the classifier stably updated. Specifically, we design and maintain two dynamic memory modules, ie, samples memory to store samples' labels and features, and centroids memory for centroids evolution. We break down the abrupt global clustering into steady memory update and batch-wise label re-assignment. The process is integrated into network update iterations. In this way, labels and the network evolve shoulder-to-shoulder rather than alternatingly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ODC stabilizes the training process and boosts the performance effectively.",

        "abstract": "Symbolic analysis of security exploits in smart contracts has demonstrated to be valuable for analyzing predefined vulnerability properties. While some symbolic tools perform complex analysis steps, they require a predetermined invocation depth to search vulnerable execution paths, and the search time increases with depth. The number of contracts on blockchains like Ethereum has increased 176 fold since December 2015. If these symbolic tools fail to analyze the increasingly large number of contracts in time, entire classes of exploits could cause irrevocable damage. In this paper, we aim to have safer smart contracts against emerging threats. We propose the approach of sequential learning of smart contract weaknesses using machine learning---long-short term memory (LSTM)---that allows us to be able to detect new attack trends relatively quickly, leading to safer smart contracts. Our experimental studies on 620,000 smart contracts prove that our model can easily scale to analyze a massive amount of contracts; that is, the LSTM maintains near constant analysis time as contracts increase in complexity. In addition, our approach achieves  test accuracy and correctly analyzes contracts that were false positive (FP) errors made by a symbolic tool.",

        "abstract": "This paper draws motivation from the remarkable ability of humans to extract useful building-blocks of knowledge from past experiences and spontaneously reuse them for new and more challenging tasks. It is contended that successfully replicating such capabilities in computational solvers, particularly global black-box optimizers, can lead to significant performance enhancements over the current state-of-the-art. The main challenge to overcome is that in general black-box settings, no problem-specific data may be available prior to the onset of the search, thereby limiting the possibility of offline measurement of the synergy between problems. In light of the above, this paper introduces a novel evolutionary computation framework that enables online learning and exploitation of similarities across optimization problems, with the goal of achieving an algorithmic realization of the transfer optimization paradigm.

A natural application of the paradigm is found to arise in the area of bi-level programming wherein an upper level optimization problem must take into consideration a nested lower level problem. Thus, while tackling instances of bi-level optimization, a significant challenge surfaces from the fact that multiple upper level candidate solutions are to be analyzed at the same time by inferring the corresponding optimum response from the lower level. Thus, the process of bi-level optimization often becomes exorbitantly time consuming, especially in the case of real-world instances involving expensive objective function evaluations.

Then the within-task and between-task genetic transfer operators are employed to reinforce the exchange of genetic material belonging to the same or different tasks. The proposed method can solve multiple measurement vector problems efficiently because the length of decision vector is independent of the number of measurement vectors.

Here, we propose Content-Conditioner (CoCon) to control an LM's output text with a content input, at a fine-grained level. In our self-supervised approach, the CoCon block learns to help the LM complete a partially-observed text sequence by conditioning with content inputs that are withheld from the LM.

A natural question is whether a model trained with an objective to produce salient Jacobian can result in better robustness. This paper answers this question with affirmative empirical results. We propose Jacobian Adversarially Regularized Networks (JARN) as a method to optimize the saliency of a classifier's Jacobian by adversarially regularizing the model's Jacobian to resemble natural training images.

Due to the widespread applications of DMOP existed in reality, DMOP has attracted much research attention in the last decade. In this article, we propose to solve DMOPs via an autoencoding evolutionary search. In particular, for tracking the dynamic changes of a given DMOP, an autoencoder is derived to predict the moving of the Pareto-optimal solutions based on the nondominated solutions obtained before the dynamic occurs. This autoencoder can be easily integrated into the existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs), for example, NSGA-II, MOEA/D, etc., for solving DMOP. In contrast to the existing approaches, the proposed prediction method holds a closed-form solution, which thus will not bring much computational burden in the iterative \u2026",

In this article, we present a novel perspective of the merits of learning in sinusoidal spaces with PINNs. By analyzing behavior at model initialization, we first show that a PINN of increasing expressiveness induces an initial bias around  flat output functions .

In these applications, additional information such as bounding-boxes, image captions and descriptions is often available during training phrase, which is referred as privileged information (PI). However, as existing works on learning using PI only consider instance-level PI (privileged instances), they fail to make use of bag-level PI (privileged bags) available in MIML learning. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a two-stream fully convolutional network, named MIML-FCN+, unified by a novel PI loss to solve the problem of MIML learning with privileged bags. Compared to the previous works on PI, the proposed MIML-FCN+ utilizes the readily available privileged bags, instead of hard-to-obtain privileged instances, making the system more general and practical in real world applications. As the proposed PI loss is convex and SGD-compatible and the framework itself is a fully convolutional network, MIML FCN+ can be easily integrated with state-of-the-art deep learning networks. Moreover, the flexibility of convolutional layers allows us to exploit structured correlations among instances to facilitate more effective training and testing. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MIML-FCN+, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in the application of multi-object recognition.",

However, its success highly relies on the object-centric priors of ImageNet, ie, different augmented views of the same image correspond to the same object. Such a heavily curated constraint becomes immediately infeasible when pre-trained on more complex scene images with many objects. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Object-level Representation Learning (ORL), a new self-supervised learning framework towards scene images. Our key insight is to leverage image-level self-supervised pre-training as the prior to discover object-level semantic correspondence, thus realizing object-level representation learning from scene images. Extensive experiments on COCO show that ORL significantly improves the performance of self-supervised learning on scene images, even surpassing supervised ImageNet pre-training on several downstream tasks. Furthermore, ORL improves the downstream performance when more unlabeled scene images are available, demonstrating its great potential of harnessing unlabeled data in the wild. We hope our approach can motivate future research on more general-purpose unsupervised representation learning from scene data.",

        "abstract": "In reputation systems for multiagent-based e-marketplaces, buying agents model the reputation of selling agents based on ratings shared by other buyers (called advisors). With the existence of unfair rating attacks from dishonest advisors, the effectiveness of reputation systems thus heavily relies on whether buyers can accurately determine which advisors to include in trust networks and their trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose a novel multiagent evolutionary trust model (MET) where each buyer evolves its trust network. In each generation, each buyer acquires trust network information from its advisors and generates a candidate trust network using evolutionary operators. Only trust networks providing more accurate seller reputation estimation shall survive to the next generation. Experimental results demonstrate MET is more robust than the state-ofthe-art trust models against various unfair rating attacks.",

        "abstract": "We present Masked Frequency Modeling (MFM), a unified frequency-domain-based approach for self-supervised pre-training of visual models. Instead of randomly inserting mask tokens to the input embeddings in the spatial domain, in this paper, we shift the perspective to the frequency domain. Specifically, MFM first masks out a portion of frequency components of the input image and then predicts the missing frequencies on the frequency spectrum. Our key insight is that predicting masked components in the frequency domain is more ideal to reveal underlying image patterns rather than predicting masked patches in the spatial domain, due to the heavy spatial redundancy. Our findings suggest that with the right configuration of mask-and-predict strategy, both the structural information within high-frequency components and the low-level statistics among low-frequency counterparts are useful in learning good representations. For the first time, MFM demonstrates that, for both ViT and CNN, a simple non-Siamese framework can learn meaningful representations even using none of the following: (i) extra data, (ii) extra model, (iii) mask token. Experimental results on image classification and semantic segmentation, as well as several robustness benchmarks show the competitive performance and advanced robustness of MFM compared with recent masked image modeling approaches. Furthermore, we also comprehensively investigate the effectiveness of classical image restoration tasks for representation learning from a unified frequency perspective and reveal their intriguing relations with our MFM approach.",

At the extreme, the predictive distributions of the source domains can differ completely from that of the target domain.

        "abstract": "The extent of the application of local searches in canonical memetic algorithm is typically based on the principle of \u201cmore is better\u201d. In the same spirit, the parallel memetic algorithm (PMA) is an important extension of the canonical memetic algorithm which applies local searches to every transitional solutions being considered. For PMA which applies a complete local search, we termed it as PMA-CLS. We show in this paper that instead of a complete local search, the island model PMA with selective application of local search (PMA-SLS) is effective in solving complex combinatorial optimization problems, in particular large-scale quadratic assignment problems (QAPs). A distinct feature of the PMA-SLS to be noted in our study is the sampling size. We make use of a normal distribution scheme to determine the sampling ratio. Empirical study on large scale QAPs with PMA-SLS and PMA-CLS are presented. It is shown that PMA-SLS arrives at solutions that are competitive to the PMA-CLS at significantly lower computation efforts on the diverse large scale QAPs considered. This we concluded is due mainly to the ability of the PMA-SLS to manage a more desirable diversity profile as the search progresses.",

However, the notion of evolutionary multitasking, which aims at solving multiple optimization problems simultaneously, has recently emerged in Evolutionary Computation (EC). It is inspired by the implicit parallelism of population-based search, which attempts to take advantage of implicit genetic transfer in a multitasking environment. According to optimization literature, transforming a single-objective optimization (SOO) problem into a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem has often been found to remove local optima. Motivated by the aforementioned idea and the concept of multitasking, in this paper, we introduce a new strategy for tackling complex multi-modal problems. In particular, we solve the original (or target) SOO task together with an artificially formulated MOO task in a multitask setting \u2026",

Learned weights of models robust to such perturbations are previously found to be transferable across different tasks but this applies only if the model architecture for the source and target tasks is the same. Input gradients characterize how small changes at each input pixel affect the model output. Using only natural images, we show here that training a student model's input gradients to match those of a robust teacher model can gain robustness close to a strong baseline that is robustly trained from scratch. Through experiments in MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we show that our proposed method, input gradient adversarial matching, can transfer robustness across different tasks and even across different model architectures. This demonstrates that directly targeting the semantics of input gradients is a feasible way towards adversarial robustness.",

Unlike traditional batch learning methods for maximizing AUC which often suffer from poor scalability, recent years have witnessed some emerging studies that attempt to maximize AUC by single-pass online learning approaches. Despite their encouraging results reported, the existing online AUC maximization algorithms often adopt simple stochastic gradient descent approaches, which fail to exploit the geometry knowledge of the data observed in the online learning process, and thus could suffer from relatively slow convergence. To overcome the limitation of the existing studies, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm of Adaptive Online AUC Maximization (AdaOAM), by applying an adaptive gradient method for exploiting the knowledge of historical gradients to perform more informative online learning. The new adaptive updating strategy by AdaOAM is less sensitive to parameter settings due to its natural effect of tuning the learning rate. In addition, the time complexity of the new algorithm remains the same as the previous non-adaptive algorithms. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we analyze its theoretical bound, and further evaluate its empirical performance on both public benchmark datasets and anomaly detection datasets. The encouraging empirical results clearly show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

However, the increasing concerns regarding the misuse of LLMs, such as plagiarism and spamming, have led to the development of multiple detectors, including fine-tuned classifiers and statistical methods. In this study, we equip LLMs with prompts, rather than relying on an external paraphraser, to evaluate the vulnerability of these detectors. We propose a novel Substitution-based In-Context example Optimization method (SICO) to automatically construct prompts for evading the detectors. SICO is cost-efficient as it requires only 40 human-written examples and a limited number of LLM inferences to generate a prompt. Moreover, once a task-specific prompt has been constructed, it can be universally used against a wide range of detectors. Extensive experiments across three real-world tasks demonstrate that SICO significantly outperforms the paraphraser baselines and enables GPT-3.5 to successfully evade six detectors, decreasing their AUC by 0.5 on average. Furthermore, a comprehensive human evaluation show that the SICO-generated text achieves human-level readability and task completion rates, while preserving high imperceptibility. Finally, we propose an ensemble approach to enhance the robustness of detectors against SICO attack. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ColinLu50/Evade-GPT-Detector.",

Existing defenses are effective under certain conditions such as a small size of the poison pattern, knowledge about the ratio of poisoned training samples or when a validated clean dataset is available. Since a defender may not have such prior knowledge or resources, we propose a defense against backdoor poisoning that is effective even when those prerequisites are not met. It is made up of several parts: one to extract a backdoor poison signal, detect poison target and base classes, and filter out poisoned from clean samples with proven guarantees. The final part of our defense involves retraining the poisoned model on a dataset augmented with the extracted poison signal and corrective relabeling of poisoned samples to neutralize the backdoor. Our approach has shown to be effective in defending against backdoor attacks that use both small and large-sized poison patterns on nine different target-base class pairs from the CIFAR10 dataset.",

Through reinforcement learning, plans can also be learned and evaluated without the rigidity of user-defined plans as used in traditional BDI systems.

To fill this gap, we propose a novel Context-aware Future Preference inference Recommender (CF-PRec) to help infer user future preference in a selfensembling manner.

In such cases, incorrectly involving all features might cause the performance to degrade. In other words, to make the model trained on the source domain work well on the target domain, it is desirable to find invariant features for domain adaption rather than using all features. However, invariant features across domains may lie in a higher order space, instead of in the original feature space. Moreover, the discriminative ability of some invariant features such as shared background information is weak, and needs to be further filtered. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel domain adaption algorithm based on an explicit feature map and feature selection.

We theoretically show that using such a transfer covariance function for general Gaussian process modelling can only capture the same similarity coefficient for all the sources, and thus may result in unsatisfactory transfer performance. This leads us to propose TC  Stack, an integrated strategy incorporating the benefits of the transfer covariance function and stacking.

First, it can identify the optimal discriminative and uncorrelated feature subset to the output labels, denoted here as Support Features, which brings about significant improvements in prediction performance over other state of the art feature selection methods considered in the paper. Second, during the learning process, the underlying group structures of correlated features associated with each support feature, denoted as Affiliated Features, can also be discovered without any additional cost.

        "abstract": "In recent decades, many meta-heuristics, including genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO) and various local search (LS) procedures have been developed for solving a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Depending on the complexity of the optimization problem, a meta-heuristic method that may have proven to be successful in the past might not work as well. Hence it is becoming a common practice to hybridize meta-heuristics and local heuristics with the aim of improving the overall performance. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive GA-ACO-LS hybrid algorithm for solving quadratic assignment problem (QAP). Empirical study on a diverse set of QAP benchmark problems shows that the proposed adaptive GA-ACO-LS converges to good solutions efficiently.

Furthermore, two variants are developed to improve the scalability and capability of VSHGP.

Therefore, PTP is essentially the knapsack problem at the strategic level with VRP at the operational level.

In fact, it can be used to approximate the feasibility boundary by means of some decision functions. The search effort can thus be focussed on the nearby region, recalling that many constrained optimization problems have their optimal solutions situated on the boundaries. This simply means that only potential individuals will undergo local refinements, reducing the number of function evaluations and accelerating the identification of the global optimum.

Satisfying these attributes shall facilitate practical deployment of transfer optimization to scenarios with big task instances, while curbing the threat of negative transfer.

Nonetheless, the feasibility of DAE for data stream analytic deserves in-depth study because it characterizes a fixed network capacity which cannot adapt to rapidly changing environments. An automated construction of a denoising autoeconder, namely deep evolving denoising autoencoder (DEVDAN), is proposed in this paper. DEVDAN features an open structure both in the generative phase and in the discriminative phase where input features can be automatically added and discarded on the fly.

This method is capable of estimating the statistical contribution of the network structure and its hidden units which precursors an ideal state to add or prune input features. Furthermore, DEVDAN is free of the problem- specific threshold and works fully in the single-pass learning fashion. The efficacy of DEVDAN is numerically validated using nine non-stationary data stream problems simulated under the prequential test-then-train protocol where DEVDAN is capable of delivering an improvement of classification accuracy to recently published online learning works while having flexibility in the automatic extraction of robust input features and in adapting to rapidly changing environments.",

Hence, DA methods which leverage the source labeled data may suffer from poor generalization in the target domain, resulting in negative transfer. In addition, we observed that many DA methods use either a source classifier or a linear combination of source classifiers with a fixed weighting for predicting the target unlabeled data.

Taking this cue, the Predictive Distribution Matching SVM (PDM-SVM) is proposed to learn a robust classifier in the target domain (referred to as the target classifier) by leveraging the labeled data from only the relevant regions of multiple sources. In particular, a k-nearest neighbor graph is iteratively constructed to identify the regions of relevant source labeled data where the predictive distribution maximally aligns with that of the target data.

In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the development of algorithms that can handle multiple objective functions at both levels. The challenge lies in the implication that every upper level decision leads to a set of Pareto optimal solutions at the lower level. As a result, a single point in the upper level decision space maps to a set of points in the upper level objective space. Since standard multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are not designed for such point-to-set mappings, the state-of-the-art solution methods often dictate several enhancements to existing MOEAs.

Its gain in attention in the field of complex designs is fuelled by advancing computing power now allowing increasingly accurate analysis codes to be deployed. Unfortunately, the optimization of complex engineering design problems remains a difficult task, due to the complexity of the cost surfaces and the human expertise necessary in order to achieve high quality results. This research is concerned with the effective use of past experiences and chronicled data from previous designs to mitigate some of the limitations of present engineering design optimization process. In particular, the present work leverages well established artificial intelligence technologies and extends recent theoretical and empirical advances, particularly in machine learning, adaptive hybrid evolutionary computation, surrogate modelling, radial basis functions and transductive inference, to mitigate the issues of i) choice of optimization methods and ii) dealing with expensive design problems. The resulting approaches are studied using commonly employed benchmark functions. Further demonstrations on realistic aerodynamic aircraft and ship design problems reveal that the proposed techniques not only generate robust design performance, they can also greatly decrease the cost of design space search and arrive at better designs as compared to conventional approaches.",

Moreover, they can only learn user intents in the latent space, which further restricts the model's transparency. To ease these issues, we propose a simple yet effective paradigm for ISR motivated by the advanced reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first create an initial prompt to instruct LLMs to predict the next item by inferring varying user intents reflected in a session. Then, we propose an effective optimization mechanism to automatically optimize prompts with an iterative self-reflection. Finally, we leverage the robust \u2026",

Besides, they suffer from expensive prediction computational costs when applied to large-scale datasets. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a Co-Hashing (CoH) method by formulating multi-label learning from the perspective of cross-view learning. CoH first regards the input and output as two views, and then aims to learn a common latent hamming space, where input and output pairs are compressed into compact binary embeddings. CoH enjoys two key benefits: 1) the input and output can be well aligned, and their correlations are explored; 2) the prediction is very efficient using fast cross-view kNN search in the hamming space. Moreover, we provide the generalization error bound for our method. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CoH over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.",

However, a common feature among these algorithms is that they focus on efficiently solving only a single problem at a time. Despite the availability of a population of individuals navigating the search space, and the implicit parallelism of their collective behavior, seldom has an effort been made to multitask. Considering the power of implicit parallelism, we are drawn to the idea that population-based search strategies provide an idyllic setting for leveraging the underlying synergies between objective function landscapes of seemingly distinct optimization tasks, particularly when they are solved together in a unified space with a single population of evolving individuals. Allowing the principles of evolution to autonomously exploit the available synergies can often lead to accelerated convergence for otherwise complex tasks. With the aim of providing deeper insight into the processes of evolutionary multitasking, we present in this paper a conceptualization of what, in our opinion, is one possible interpretation of the complementarity between optimization tasks. In particular, we propose a functional synergy metric that captures the correlation between objective function landscapes of distinct tasks placed in synthetic multitasking environments. In the long run, it is contended that the metric will serve as an important guide toward better understanding of evolutionary multitasking, thereby facilitating the design of improved multitasking engines.",

Being able to track the location of a Wi-Fi or Radio Frequency Identification device could improve the quality of services in various sectors, including security, warehouse, logistic management, and healthcare. As compared with outdoor environment, positioning systems face a greater challenge in indoor environment because wireless signal is significantly influenced by building layout and surrounding objects, for which a location fingerprinting approach is needed. Moreover, the signal strength of a wireless device may also change over time, which is known as temporal variation, and therefore a reliable location estimation system must have the ability to learn and adapt with temporal changes.

        "abstract": "In this work, we identified a large number of structurally distinct isomers of midsized deprotonated water clusters, OH\u2212(H2O)n=4\u20137, using first-principles methods. The temperature dependence of the structural variation in the solvation shell of OH\u2212 for these clusters was examined under the harmonic superposition approximation. We simulated the vibrational and photoelectron spectra based on these thermodynamic calculations. We found that the isomers with 3-coordinated hydroxide dominate the population in these midsized clusters. Furthermore, an increase in temperature causes a topological change from compact isomers with many intermolecular hydrogen bonds to open isomers with fewer but more directional intermolecular hydrogen bonds. We showed that this evolution in structure can be observed through the change in the vibrational spectra at 3200\u20133400 cm\u22121. In addition, the increase in directional \u2026",

The framework of the algorithm involves hill-valley initialization, valley-adaptive clearing and archiving.

In this paper, we introduce the application of latent semantic analysis (LSA) to microarray expression data for systematic, genome-wide functional classification of genes.In the LSA approach considered here, singular value decomposition is first applied as a dimensionreducing step on the gene expression data, followed by an unsupervised clustering procedure based on vector similarities in the truncated space. Functional classification is then conducted through calling by majority on each of the resulting gene clusters. Using this semi-supervised LSA approach on microarray data, we have performed systematic functional classification on the genes in the partially-annotated yeast genome, annotating more than 1,700 unknown genes into 40 distinct functional classes with promising results.",

However, in a practical scenario, it is quite natural that the data labels are available only after some temporal lag. This paper explores how a stream classifier model can be made adaptive to such label latency scenario. We propose SkipE-RNN, a self-evolutionary recurrent neural network with dynamically evolving skipped-recurrent-connection for the best utilization of previously observed label information while classifying the current data. When the data label is unavailable, SkipE-RNN uses an auto-learned mapping function to find the best match from the already known data labels and updates the network parameter accordingly. Later, upon availability of true data label, if the previously mapped label is found to be incorrect, SkipE-RNN employs a regularization technique along with the parameter updating process, so as to penalize the model. In addition, SkipE-RNN has inborn power of self-adjusting the network capacity by growing/pruning hidden nodes to cope with the evolving nature of data stream. Rigorous empirical evaluations using synthetic as well as real-world datasets reveal effectiveness of SkipE-RNN in both finitely delayed and infinitely delayed data label scenarios.",

A setup which provides an interactive distance learning environment capability is also included. Lecturers are given the ability to plan and design new power system scenarios easily, while students will work with these designed scenarios. All that is required is any Java-enabled terminal connected to the Internet. A six-bus, two generator system under light, medium and peak load conditions is used to illustrate the underlying principles of power system operation and control.

Unfortunately, these approaches suffer expensive computation and memory costs in large-scale settings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel deep binary prototype compression (DBPC) for fast multilabel prediction. DBPC compresses the database into a small set of short binary prototypes, and uses the prototypes for prediction. The benefit of DBPC comes from two aspects: 1) The number of distance comparisons is reduced in the prototype; 2) The distance computation cost is significantly decreased in the Hamming space. We propose to jointly learn the deep latent subspace and binary prototypes within a unified framework. The encoding and decoding neural networks are employed to make deep binary prototypes well represent the instances and labels. Extensive experiments \u2026",

Therefore, intra-hour optimal power flow (OPF) calculations considering most likely scenarios are mandatory to maintain the economy and the security requirements of power system operations to ensure the reliability of the electricity supply. On the other hand, traditional meta-heuristic methods which are more suitable as per the structure of OPF problems, may not be practical due to longer execution times. To address these issues, we present an evolutionary multitasking framework for parallel execution of multiple OPF problems at different load demands. The simulation results show that multitasking substantially improves the utilization of evolutionary algorithms in OPF problems showing the potential for computations in fast timescale in comparison to canonical evolutionary algorithms (EA).",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of Internet and Web techniques, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) models have been widely explored for resolving the data-sparsity and cold-start problem. Meanwhile, most CDR models should utilize explicit domain-shareable information (e.g., overlapped users or items) for knowledge transfer across domains. However, this assumption may not be always satisfied since users and items are always non-overlapped in real practice. The performance of many previous works will be severely impaired when these domain-shareable information are not available. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose the Joint Preference Exploration and Dynamic Embedding Transportation model (JPEDET) in this paper which is a novel framework for solving the CDR problem when users and items are non-overlapped. JPEDET includes two main modules, i.e., joint preference exploration module and dynamic embedding transportation module. The joint preference exploration module aims to fuse rating and review information for modelling user preferences. The dynamic embedding transportation module is set to share knowledge via neural ordinary equations for dual transformation across domains. Moreover, we innovatively propose the dynamic transport flow equipped with linear interpolation guidance on barycentric Wasserstein path for achieving accurate and bidirectional transformation. Our empirical study on Amazon datasets demonstrates that JPEDET significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models under the CDR setting.",

However, in reality, data usually reside in distributed parties such as different institutions and may not be directly gathered and integrated due to various data policy constraints. As a result, some parties may suffer from insufficient data available for training machine learning models. In this article, we propose a multiparty dual learning (MPDL) framework to alleviate the problem of limited data with poor quality in an isolated party. Since the knowledge-sharing processes for multiple parties always emerge in dual forms, we show that dual learning is naturally suitable to handle the challenge of missing data, and explicitly exploits the probabilistic correlation and structural relationship between dual tasks to regularize the training process.

In the proposed MARL, each reinforcement learner learns and evolves in the dynamic environment, and is steered by flocking behavior rules such as cohesion, separation, alignment, fear, etcs. The use of the flocking rules provides distributed sensing and communication content for the cooperation of multiple learning agents in the context of pursuit game.

Second, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that the singularities have a significant impact on the learning dynamics of RBF networks. Our results show that overlap singularities mainly have influence on the low dimensional RBF networks and elimination singularities have a more significant impact to the learning processes than overlap singularities in both low and high dimensional RBF networks, whereas the plateau phenomena are mainly caused by the elimination singularities.

For accounting purpose, a system is required to gather, maintain, and process the information of Grid jobs submitted by different users possibly from different organizations involved in the resource sharing. In this paper, we present a general architecture on the implementation of a Grid Accounting System which supports a multi organizational Grid. The architecture comprises of a number of modular components can be easily integrated with the various Grid middlewares and softwares. A more detailed implementation of the system integrated with Globus Toolkit middleware is also presented here as a case study.",

However there is often little theoretical basis on which to characterize the choice of memes that lead to successful memetic algorithm performance. In this paper, we investigate empirically the use of different memes in the memetic algorithms across a variety of benchmark test functions for function optimization.

Further, an investigation on the random choice of memes at each decision point during the memetic algorithm search arrives at interesting results.",

Here, we take one step further to more directly study the frequency bias of a model through the lens of its Jacobians and its implication to model robustness. To achieve this, we propose Jacobian frequency regularization for models' Jacobians to have a larger ratio of low-frequency components. Through experiments on four image datasets, we show that biasing classifiers towards low (high)-frequency components can bring performance gain against high (low)-frequency corruption and adversarial perturbation, albeit with a tradeoff in performance for low (high)-frequency corruption.

For us humans, emotions aid our learning, communication, and decision-making. Hence, over the past two decades, there has been a significant effort to incorporate cognitive capabilities into machines so that they can interpret, comprehend and express emotions. Computational analysis of human multimodal language is an emerging research area in natural language processing (NLP). It expands the horizons of NLP to study language used in \u2026",

In general, the difficulty of a problem exponentially increases with the number of objectives, serving as a clear example of the curse of dimensionality. The exploratory approach an EA takes in these cases has led to it being thought of as a big data generator, progressively sampling and evaluating solutions in high performing regions of a decision space to guide the search towards optimal solutions. Notably, in both multi- and many-objective EAs, the sampled data can be further utilized for building inverse generative models, mapping points in objective space back to solutions in the decision space. Such models offer immense flexibility to a decision maker in generating new target solutions on the fly, thereby facilitating \u2026",

Given such an issue, we denote the frame importance as its contribution to the expected reward on a particular frame, and hypothesize that adapting such frame importance could benefit the performance of the distilled student policy. To verify our hypothesis, we analyze why and how frame importance matters in RL settings. Based on the analysis, we propose an importance prioritized PD framework that highlights the training on important frames, so as to learn efficiently.

Unlike traditional batch learning methods for maximizing AUC which often suffer from poor scalability, recent years have witnessed some emerging studies that attempt to maximize AUC by single-pass online learning approaches. Despite their encouraging results reported, the existing online AUC maximization algorithms often adopt simple online gradient descent approaches that fail to exploit the geometrical knowledge of the data observed during the online learning process, and thus could suffer from relatively larger regret. To address the above limitation, in this work, we explore a novel algorithm of Adaptive Online AUC Maximization (AdaOAM) which employs an adaptive gradient method that exploits the knowledge of historical gradients to perform more informative online learning. The new adaptive updating strategy of the AdaOAM is less sensitive to the parameter settings and maintains the same time complexity as previous non-adaptive counterparts. Additionally, we extend the algorithm to handle high-dimensional sparse data (SAdaOAM) and address sparsity in the solution by performing lazy gradient updating. We analyze the theoretical bounds and evaluate their empirical performance on various types of data sets. The encouraging empirical results obtained clearly highlighted the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.",

However, these scalable GPCs equipped with analytical ELBO are limited to specific likelihoods or additional assumptions. In this work, we present a unifying framework which accommodates scalable GPCs using various likelihoods. Analogous to GP regression (GPR), we introduce additive noises to augment the probability space for (i) the GPCs with step, (multinomial) probit and logit likelihoods via the internal variables; and particularly, (ii) the GPC using softmax likelihood via the noise variables themselves. This leads to unified scalable GPCs with analytical ELBO by using variational inference.

        "abstract": "The field of computational intelligence (CI) has taken flight and for the last decades served in a large part of computer science and engineering literature as a field that devotes to the development and implementations of various new methodologies for solving complex problems successfully. Memetic Algorithm (MA), also commonly known as hybrid evolutionary algorithms (EAs), or genetic local search, represents a recent established field of CI that has attracted increasing research interest. In parallel to the MA definition and early diffusion, a strictly related concept, ie hyper-heuristic, was defined as an algorithm composed of multiple algorithmic components coordinated by a supervisor element. Recent developments of memetic computing can lead to the fusion of (canonical) memetic algorithms and meta-heuristics, especially of the adaptive rules in the coordination mechanisms. Since MAs were not proposed as specific optimization algorithms, but as a broad class of algorithms inspired by the diffusion of the ideas and composed of multiple existing operators, the community started showing an increasing attention towards these algorithmic structures as a general guideline for addressing specific problems. In this chapter, our focus is on the design of memetic frameworks for solving continuous complex optimization problems. Some key factors responsible for the success of these frameworks are identified and presented into two levels of design as guideline for the practitioners.",

Given the potential data heterogeneity, it is crucial to select appropriate collaborators for each FL participant (FL-PT) based on data complementarity. Recent studies have addressed this challenge. Similarly, it is imperative to consider the inter-individual relationships among FL-PTs where a part of FL-PTs engage in competitive behaviors. Although FL literature has acknowledged the significance of this scenario, practical methods for establishing FL ecosystems with these dynamics remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we extend a principle from balance theory, namely ``the friend of my enemy is my enemy'', to ensure the absence of conflicting interests within an FL ecosystem. The extended principle and the resulting problem are formulated via graph theory and integer linear programming; further, a polynomial-time algorithm is proposed to determine the collaborators of each FL-PT. The solution guarantees high scalability, allowing even competing FL-PTs to smoothly join the ecosystem without conflicts of interest. The framework of this paper is also general where competition and data heterogeneity are both considered. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework and its ability to establish efficient collaboration networks for FL ecosystems.",

One of the important design issues of MAs is the choice of individuals produced by the global search method upon which the local search procedure should be applied. Selecting only some potential individuals lessens the demand for functional evaluations hence accelerates convergence to the global optimum. In recent years, advances have been made targeting optimization problems with either inequality constraints g (x)\u2264 0 or single equality constraint h (x)= 0. The earlier utilized the feasibility class (feasible or infeasible) of previously evaluated candidate solutions while the latter made use of their raw constraint values.

        "abstract": "Real-time solutions to the influence blocking maximization (IBM) problems are crucial for promptly containing the spread of misinformation. However, achieving this goal is non-trivial, mainly because assessing the blocked influence of an IBM problem solution typically requires plenty of expensive Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs). Although several approaches have been proposed to enhance efficiency, they still fail to achieve real-time solutions to IBM problems of practical scales. This work presents a novel approach that enables solving IBM problems with hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges in seconds. The key idea is to construct a fast-to-evaluate surrogate model, called neural influence estimator (NIE), as a substitute for the time-intensive MCSs. To this end, a learning problem is formulated to build the NIE that takes the false-and-true information instance as input, extracts features describing the topology and inter-relationship between two seed sets, and predicts the blocked influence. A well-trained NIE can generalize across different IBM problems defined on a social network, and can be readily combined with existing IBM optimization algorithms such as the greedy algorithm. The experiments on 25 IBM problems with up to millions of edges show that the NIE-based optimization method can be up to four orders of magnitude faster than MCSs-based optimization method to achieve the same solution quality. Moreover, given a real-time constraint of one minute, the NIE-based method can solve IBM problems with up to hundreds of thousands of nodes, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than what can be solved by existing \u2026",

Hence, we propose to build multiple GP models instead of a single GP surrogate to complement each other, thus resolving the suboptimal problem of BO. Nevertheless, according to the bias-variance tradeoff equation, the individual prediction errors can increase when increasing the diversity of models, which may lead even worse overall surrogate accuracy.

        "abstract": "In recent years, to improve the evolutionary algorithms used to solve optimization problems involving a large number of decision variables, many attempts have been made to simplify the problem solution space of a given problem for the evolutionary search. In the literature, the existing approaches can generally be categorized as decomposition-based methods and dimension-reduction-based methods. The former decomposes a large-scale problem into several smaller subproblems, while the latter transforms the original high-dimensional solution space into a low-dimensional space. However, it is worth noting that a given large-scale optimization problem may not always be decomposable, and it is also difficult to guarantee that the global optimum of the original problem is preserved in the reduced low-dimensional problem space. This paper thus proposes a new search paradigm, namely the multi-space evolutionary search, to enhance the existing evolutionary search methods for solving large-scale optimization problems. In contrast to existing approaches that perform an evolutionary search in a single search space, the proposed paradigm is designed to conduct a search in multiple solution spaces that are derived from the given problem, each possessing a unique landscape. The proposed paradigm makes no assumptions about the large-scale optimization problem of interest, such as that the problem is decomposable or that a certain relationship exists among the decision variables. To verify the efficacy of the proposed paradigm, comprehensive empirical studies in comparison to four state-of-the-art algorithms were conducted using the \u2026",

However, how to enable the attention mechanisms in GATs to smoothly consider both structural and feature information is still very challenging. In this paper, we propose Graph Joint Attention Networks (JATs) to address the aforementioned challenge. Different from previous attention-based graph neural networks (GNNs), JATs adopt novel joint attention mechanisms which can automatically determine the relative significance between node features and structural coefficients learned from graph subspace, when computing the attention scores. Therefore, representations concerning more structural properties can be inferred by JATs. Besides, we theoretically analyze the expressive power of JATs and further propose an improved strategy for the joint attention mechanisms that enables JATs to reach the upper bound of expressive power which every message-passing GNN can ultimately achieve, i.e., 1-WL test. JATs can thereby be seen as most powerful message-passing GNNs. The proposed neural architecture has been extensively tested on widely used benchmarking datasets, including Cora, Cite, and Pubmed and has been compared with state-of-the-art GNNs for node classification tasks. Experimental results show that JATs achieve state-of-the-art performance on all the testing datasets.",

Unlike the classical treatment of a set of mean-variance optimized portfolios as a deterministic efficient frontier, we adopt a novel treatment of the frontier as a distribution of points on a statistical front. This is made possible by our stochastic algorithms, specifically an evolutionary programming (EP) approach that is able to derive meaningful portfolios for the statistical front. More importantly, the EP approach is inherently a parallel search algorithm, making it amenable to exploit the immense computational resources that a grid computing architecture can provide. In order to derive statistically meaningful front, one requires a great number of points to form the efficient band. With a grid computing framework, one is able to farm out such computationally expensive tasks and derive\" interesting\" portfolios to create the band. Such a capability lays the necessary backbone for developing further analytic methodology for portfolio rebalancing, an important aspect of financial planning. This is significant since in recent years, financial planning has permeated into the mindset of the population. The level of awareness is set to increase with the population's growing affluence.",

        "abstract": "Engineering design optimization requires an efficient combination of a 3D shape representation, an optimization algorithm, and a design performance evaluation method, which is often computationally expensive. We present a prompt evolution design optimization (PEDO) framework contextualized in a vehicle design scenario that leverages a vision-language model for penalizing impractical car designs synthesized by a generative model. The backbone of our framework is an evolutionary strategy coupled with an optimization objective function that comprises a physics-based solver and a vision-language model for practical or functional guidance in the generated car designs. In the prompt evolutionary search, the optimizer iteratively generates a population of text prompts, which embed user specifications on the aerodynamic performance and visual preferences of the 3D car designs. Then, in addition to the computational fluid dynamics simulations, the pre-trained vision-language model is used to penalize impractical designs and, thus, foster the evolutionary algorithm to seek more viable designs. Our investigations on a car design optimization problem show a wide spread of potential car designs generated at the early phase of the search, which indicates a good diversity of designs in the initial populations, and an increase of over 20\\% in the probability of generating practical designs compared to a baseline framework without using a vision-language model. Visual inspection of the designs against the performance results demonstrates prompt evolution as a very promising paradigm for finding novel designs with good optimization \u2026",

In this paper, we identify the limitations of existing methods, particularly their overemphasis on the distance effect as outlined in the First Law of Geography. In response, we propose to endow road network representation with the principles of the recent Third Law of Geography. To this end, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning framework that employs geographic configuration-aware graph augmentation and spectral negative sampling, ensuring that road segments with similar geographic configurations yield similar representations, and vice versa, aligning with the principles stated in the Third Law. The framework further fuses the Third Law with the First Law through a dual contrastive learning objective to effectively balance the implications of both laws. We evaluate our framework on two real-world datasets across three downstream tasks. The results show that the integration of the Third Law significantly improves the performance of road segment representations in downstream tasks.",

However, current studies are limited to generating (1) fixed-size or single bundles, and most importantly, (2) bundles that do not reflect consistent user intents, thus being less intelligible or useful to users. This paper explores two interrelated tasks, i.e., personalized bundle generation and the underlying intent inference based on users' interactions in a session, leveraging the logical reasoning capability of large language models. We introduce a dynamic in-context learning paradigm, which enables ChatGPT to seek tailored and dynamic lessons from closely related sessions as demonstrations while performing tasks in the target session. Specifically, it first harnesses retrieval augmented generation to identify nearest neighbor sessions for each target session. Then, proper prompts are designed to guide ChatGPT to perform the two tasks on neighbor sessions. To enhance reliability and mitigate the hallucination issue, we develop (1) a self-correction strategy to foster mutual improvement in both tasks without supervision signals; and (2) an auto-feedback mechanism to recurrently offer dynamic supervision based on the distinct mistakes made by ChatGPT on various neighbor sessions. Thus, the target session can receive customized and dynamic lessons for improved performance by observing the demonstrations of its neighbor sessions. Finally, experimental results on three real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our methods on both tasks. Additionally, the inferred intents can prove beneficial for other intriguing downstream tasks, such as crafting appealing \u2026",

Precisely, we first investigate the feasibility and performance of a family of transfer covariance functions that represent the pairwise similarity of each source and the target domain. We theoretically show that using such a transfer covariance function for general GP modeling can only capture the same similarity coefficient for all the sources, and thus may result in unsatisfactory transfer performance. This outcome, together with the scalability issues of a single GP based approach, leads us to propose TC MS Stack, an integrated framework incorporating a separate transfer covariance function for each source and stacking \u2026",

In this paper, we present an evolutionary algorithm that in the absence of data on travel time uncertainty, provides a decision maker with a collection of solutions, each with a corresponding level of trade-off between total travel distance and solution robustness. In particular, we present a novel realization of route flexibility and its relation to solution robustness.

This paper examines this situation and proposes to model the estimation errors through function approximation thereby making a priori error estimates available for new signals frequencies. The technique is shown to perform well on simulation data under varying noise conditions. Results show that it is possible to estimate frequencies in the ULF region with accuracies similar to those encountered in higher frequency ranges.",

A direct extension as well as an efficient modification of the LSI model applied to numerical data problems are presented and the associated problems and likely remedies discussed. The techniques under investigation are shown to perform competitively with respect to popular existing numerical classification techniques on a range of synthetic and real world benchmark data.

In this article, we extend the original FSIC task by incorporating defense against malicious adversarial examples. This can be an arduous challenge because numerous deep learning-based approaches remain susceptible to adversarial examples, even when trained with ample amounts of data. Previous studies on this problem have predominantly concentrated on the meta-learning framework, which involves sampling numerous few-shot tasks during the training stage. In contrast, we propose a straightforward but effective baseline via learning robust and discriminative representations without tedious meta-task sampling, which can further be generalized to unforeseen adversarial FSIC tasks.

        "abstract": "Adversarially robust knowledge distillation aims to compress large-scale models into lightweight models while preserving adversarial robustness and natural performance on a given dataset. Existing methods typically align probability distributions of natural and adversarial samples between teacher and student models but they overlook intermediate adversarial samples along the\" adversarial path\" formed by the multi-step gradient ascent of a sample towards the decision boundary. Such paths capture rich information about the decision boundary. In this paper we propose a novel adversarially robust knowledge distillation approach by incorporating such adversarial paths into the alignment process. Recognizing the diverse impacts of intermediate adversarial samples (ranging from benign to noisy) we propose an adaptive weighting strategy to selectively emphasize informative adversarial samples thus ensuring efficient utilization of lightweight model capacity. Moreover we propose a dual-branch mechanism exploiting two following insights:(i) complementary dynamics of adversarial paths obtained by targeted and untargeted adversarial learning and (ii) inherent differences between the gradient ascent path from class c_i towards the nearest class boundary and the gradient descent path from a specific class c_j towards the decision region of c_i (i\\neq j). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on lightweight models under various settings.",

        "abstract": "Transfer optimization enables data-efficient optimization of a target task by leveraging experiential priors from related source tasks. This is especially useful in multiobjective optimization settings where a set of trade-off solutions is sought under tight evaluation budgets. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of inverse transfer in multiobjective optimization. Inverse transfer stands out by employing probabilistic inverse models to map performance vectors in the objective space to population search distributions in task-specific decision space, facilitating knowledge transfer through objective space unification. Building upon this idea, we introduce the first Inverse Transfer Multiobjective Evolutionary Optimizer (invTrEMO). A key highlight of invTrEMO is its ability to harness the common objective functions prevalent in many application areas, even when decision spaces do not precisely align between tasks. This allows invTrEMO to uniquely and effectively utilize information from heterogeneous source tasks as well. Furthermore, invTrEMO yields high-precision inverse models as a significant byproduct, enabling the generation of tailored solutions on-demand based on user preferences. Empirical studies on multi- and many-objective benchmark problems, as well as a practical case study, showcase the faster convergence rate and modelling accuracy of the invTrEMO relative to state-of-the-art evolutionary and Bayesian optimization algorithms. The source code of the invTrEMO is made available at https://github.com/LiuJ-2023/invTrEMO.",

However, due to increasing demand for users' privacy and security, we often need to remove users' data information from Machine Learning (ML) models to satisfy specific privacy and security requirements. This need requires the ANN search algorithm to support fast online data deletion and insertion. Current learning-based hashing methods need retraining the hash function, which is prohibitable due to the vast time-cost of large-scale data. To address this problem, we propose a novel data-dependent hashing method named unfolded self-reconstruction locality-sensitive hashing (USR-LSH). Our USR-LSH unfolded the optimization update for instance-wise data reconstruction, which is better for preserving data information than data-independent LSH. Moreover, our USR-LSH supports fast online data deletion and insertion without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the machine unlearning of retrieval problems. Empirically, we demonstrate that USR-LSH outperforms the state-of-the-art data-distribution-independent LSH in ANN tasks in terms of precision and recall. We also show that USR-LSH has significantly faster data deletion and insertion time than learning-based data-dependent hashing.",

        "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been proposed as a potential route to inverse modelling or mesh-free alternative to numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs). However, these problems typically lack ground truth, making selection of more accurate PINN models difficult, especially with processes such as hyper-parameter tuning. This is exacerbated as PINNs need to balance multiple objectives, comprising the governing PDEs, associated boundary/initial conditions, and/or point data. Under this multi-objective optimization framework, the ideal PINN solution is one that achieves zero loss across all components although this is not typical, resulting in a Pareto set of models. Nonetheless, there are objectively-preferred models based on congruence to unknown ground truth. In this context, we propose a Pareto front-based analysis to help identify better performing models. First, an approximation to the Pareto set of solutions with minimal PINN loss is constructed for different balances of loss weights. A loss weight located on the convex bulge of the Pareto front is then selected to rescale the training loss across all solutions. Across our experiments, this rescaling demonstrates a strong correlation between the rescaled PINN loss and mean squared error (MSE) relative to simulated ground truth, thereby illustrating potential PINN model selection.",

Faster convergence under strict function evaluation budgets - often in the order of a hundred or fewer function evaluations - is thus expected, overcoming the cold start problem of conventional Bayesian optimization algorithms. In this short paper, we prove that the regret bounds can be further tightened when extending the method to multi-source settings (where each source may depict distinct source-target correlation), while also achieving internal algorithmic complexity that's only linear in the number of sources. Experimental results, on both synthetic test functions as well as a practical case study, verify our theoretical claim of performance gain.",

In future, learning on small data that approximates the generalization ability of big data is one of the ultimate purposes of AI, which requires machines to recognize objectives and scenarios relying on small data as humans. A series of learning topics is going on this way such as active learning and few-shot learning. However, there are few theoretical guarantees for their generalization performance. Moreover, most of their settings are passive, that is, the label distribution is explicitly controlled by finite training resources from known distributions. This survey follows the agnostic active sampling theory under a PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) framework to analyze the generalization error and label complexity of learning on small data in model-agnostic supervised and unsupervised fashion. Considering multiple learning communities could produce small data representation and related topics have been well surveyed, we thus subjoin novel geometric representation perspectives for small data: the Euclidean and non-Euclidean (hyperbolic) mean, where the optimization solutions including the Euclidean gradients, non-Euclidean gradients, and Stein gradient are presented and discussed. Later, multiple learning communities that may be improved by learning on small data are summarized, which yield data-efficient representations, such as transfer learning, contrastive learning, graph representation learning. Meanwhile, we find that the meta-learning may provide effective parameter update policies for learning on small data \u2026",

However, environments with tight resource constraints, changing objectives and intentions, or varied task requirements, could limit the real-world utility of a singular JAT. Hence, in tandem with current trends towards building increasingly large JATs, this paper conducts an initial exploration into concepts underlying the creation of a diverse set of compact machine learning model sets. Composed of many smaller and specialized models, we formulate the Set of Sets to simultaneously fulfil many task settings and environmental conditions. A means to arrive at such a set tractably in one pass of a neuroevolutionary multitasking algorithm is presented for the first time, bringing us closer to models that are collectively 'Masters of All Trades'.",

However, the notion of evolutionary multitasking, which aims at solving multiple optimization problems simultaneously, has recently emerged in Evolutionary Computation (EC). It is inspired by the implicit parallelism of population-based search, which attempts to take advantage of implicit genetic transfer in a multitasking environment. According to optimization literature, transforming a single-objective optimization (SOO) problem into a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem has often been found to remove local optima. Motivated by the aforementioned idea and the concept of multitasking, in this paper, we introduce a new strategy for tackling complex multi-modal problems. In particular, we solve the original (or target) SOO task together with an artificially formulated MOO task in a multitask setting. Therein, the MOO task is expected to provide a useful inductive bias to the search progress of the target SOO task by leveraging on the transferable knowledge shared between them, thereby helping overcome local optima and effectively guiding the population towards more promising regions of the search space.",

Particularly, we perform a comprehensive investigation on two EA methods, namely, a simple mutation-based method and then the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) for minimizing the uploading delay.

In this paper, we present some recent successes of memetic computation and experiences for the discovery of first-order saddle points or transition states in biochemical systems.

To keep ischaemia time as the only variable in the study, no immunosupressive theray was given. A total of 10 rats were divided into 2 groups. Group A (n= 5) had ischaemia time of 1 hour while the Group B had ischaemia time of 3 hours. All the flaps were biopsied at 6 days and 13 days post-transplantation. They were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin and the severity of the acute rejection graded using criteria like perivascular lympocytic infiltrates, epidermal infiltrates, stromal infiltrates, eosinophils, spongiosis and endothelial plumping.Results: Gross signs of early rejection like erythema, macular rash and edema were observed as early as 6 days and the flap was completely rejected by 13 days post-transplant. Histologically, a moderate acute rejection was seen in both groups at day 6. Greater than 50% of the vessels showed perovascular infiltrates that were accompanied by epidermal infiltrates and stromal inflammation. There was no spongiosis, endothelial plumping, eosinophils and large lymphocytes.

To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose Adaptive Rendering loss regularization for few-shot NeRF, dubbed AR-NeRF. Specifically, we present a two-phase rendering supervision and an adaptive rendering loss weight learning strategy to align the frequency relationship between PE and 2D-pixel supervision.

Numerous algorithms have emerged to address the challenges posed by transferring knowledge between tasks. However, the recently highlighted ``no free lunch theorem'' in transfer optimization clarifies that no single algorithm reigns supreme across diverse problem types. This paper addresses this conundrum by adopting a benchmarking approach to evaluate the performance of various TrEO algorithms in realistic scenarios. Despite the growing methodological focus on transfer optimization, existing benchmark problems often fall short due to inadequate design, predominantly featuring synthetic problems that lack real-world relevance. This paper pioneers a practical TrEO benchmark suite, integrating problems from the literature categorized based on the three essential aspects of Big Source Task-Instances: volume, variety, and velocity. Our primary objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis of existing TrEO algorithms and pave the way for the development of new approaches to tackle practical challenges. By introducing realistic benchmarks that embody the three dimensions of volume, variety, and velocity, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of algorithmic performance in the face of diverse and complex transfer scenarios. This benchmark suite is poised to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, facilitating the refinement and advancement of TrEO algorithms in the pursuit of solving real-world problems.",

In such circumstances, a single solution can rarely optimize all the tasks, leading to performance trade-offs. To arrive at a set of optimized yet well-distributed models that collectively embody different trade-offs in one algorithmic pass, this paper proposes to view Pareto multi-task learning through the lens of multi-task optimization. Multi-task learning is first cast as a multi-objective optimization problem, which is then decomposed into a diverse set of unconstrained scalar-valued subproblems. These subproblems are solved jointly using a novel multi-task gradient descent method, whose uniqueness lies in the iterative transfer of model parameters among the subproblems during the course of optimization. A theorem proving faster convergence through the inclusion of such transfers is presented. We investigate the proposed multi-task learning with multi-task optimization for solving various problem settings including image classification, scene understanding, and multi-target regression. Comprehensive experiments confirm that the proposed method significantly advances the state-of-the-art in discovering sets of Pareto-optimized models. Notably, on the large image dataset we tested on, namely NYUv2, the hypervolume convergence achieved by our method was found to be nearly two times faster than the next-best among the state-of-the-art.",

By analyzing the solid mechanics of generated 3D shapes, we reveal that the 3D shapes generated by existing text-to-3D generation methods are impractical for real-world applications as the generated 3D shapes do not conform to the laws of physics. To this end, we leverage 3D diffusion models to provide 3D shape priors and design a data-driven differentiable physics layer to optimize 3D shape priors with solid mechanics. This allows us to optimize geometry efficiently and learn precise physics information about 3D shapes at the same time.

        "abstract": "With the proliferation of spatio-textual data, Top-k KNN spatial keyword queries (TkQs), which return a list of objects based on a ranking function that evaluates both spatial and textual relevance, have found many real-life applications. Existing geo-textual indexes for TkQs use traditional retrieval models like BM25 to compute text relevance and usually exploit a simple linear function to compute spatial relevance, but its effectiveness is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues. To the best of our knowledge, there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel technique, which Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data for answering embedding based spatial keyword queries (called LIST). LIST is featured with two novel components. Firstly, we propose a lightweight and effective relevance model that is capable of learning both textual and spatial relevance. Secondly, we introduce a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) index, which utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. Two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index are the absence of high-quality labels and unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Experimental results show that LIST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on effectiveness, with \u2026",

Existing adversarially robust FSL methods rely on either visual similarity learning or class concept learning. Our analysis reveals that these two learning paradigms are complementary exhibiting distinct robustness due to their unique decision boundary types (concepts clustering by the visual similarity label vs. classification by the class labels). To bridge this gap we propose a novel framework unifying adversarially robust similarity learning and class concept learning. Specifically we distill parameters from both network branches into a\" unified embedding model\" during robust optimization and redistribute them to individual network branches periodically. To capture generalizable robustness across diverse branches we initialize adversaries in each episode with cross-branch class-wise\" global adversarial perturbations\" instead of less informative random initialization. We also propose a branch robustness harmonization to modulate the optimization of similarity and class concept learners via their relative adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method in diverse few-shot scenarios.",

In this paper, the potential of discovering PINNs that generalize over an entire family of physics tasks is studied, for the first time, through a biological lens of the Baldwin effect. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. To this end, evolutionary selection pressure (guided by proficiency over a family of tasks) is coupled with lifetime learning (to specialize on a smaller subset of those tasks) to produce PINNs that demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances. The Baldwinian approach achieves an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art results with PINNs meta-learned by gradient descent. This paper marks a leap forward in the meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers.",

Motivated by several significant practical applications, this work investigates a novel variant of MCKP called data-driven chance-constrained multiple-choice knapsack problem (DDCCMCKP), where the item weight is a random variable with unknown probability distribution. We first present the problem formulation of DDCCMCKP, and then establish two benchmark sets. The first set contains synthetic instances, and the second set is devised to simulate a real-world application scenario of a certain telecommunication company. To solve DDCCMCKP, we propose a data-driven adaptive local search (DDALS) algorithm. The main merit of DDALS lies in evaluating solutions with chance constraints by data-driven methods, under the condition of unknown distributions and only historical sample data being available. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that it is superior to other baselines. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the necessity of each component in the algorithm. Our proposed algorithm can serve as the baseline for future research, and the code and benchmark sets will be open-sourced to further promote research on this challenging problem.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel loss formulation for efficient learning of complex dynamics from governing physics, typically described by partial differential equations (PDEs), using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In our experiments, existing versions of PINNs are seen to learn poorly in many problems, especially for complex geometries, as it becomes increasingly difficult to establish appropriate sampling strategy at the near boundary region. Overly dense sampling can adversely impede training convergence if the local gradient behaviors are too complex to be adequately modelled by PINNs. On the other hand, if the samples are too sparse, PINNs may over-fit the near boundary region, leading to incorrect solution. To prevent such issues, we propose a new Boundary Connectivity (BCXN) loss function which provides local structure approximation at the boundary. Our BCXN-loss can implicitly or explicitly impose such approximations during training, thus facilitating fast physics-informed learning across entire problem domains with order of magnitude fewer training samples. This method shows a few orders of magnitude smaller errors than existing methods in terms of the standard L2-norm metric, while using dramatically fewer training samples and iterations. Our proposed Fast-PINN method does not pose any requirement on the differentiable property of the networks, and we demonstrate its benefits and ease of implementation on both multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network versions as commonly used in current physics-informed neural network literature.",

However, they do not work well in skew request distributions, which impair load balancing but simultaneously increase the effectiveness of caching and replication. In this paper, we propose Cloud Cache (C2), an adaptive load balancing scheme for metadata server cluster in Cloud-scale file systems. It combines adaptive cache diffusion and replication scheme to cope with the request load balancing problem, and it can be integrated into existing distributed metadata management approaches to efficiently improve their load balancing performance.

        "abstract": "A significantly under-explored area of evolutionary optimization in the literature is the study of optimization methodologies that can evolve along with the problems solved. Particularly, present evolutionary optimization approaches generally start their search from scratch or the ground-zero state of knowledge, independent of how similar the given new problem of interest is to those optimized previously. There has thus been the apparent lack of automated knowledge transfers and reuse across problems. Taking the cue, this paper introduces a novel Memetic Computational Paradigm for search, one that models after how human solves problems, and embarks on a study towards intelligent evolutionary optimization of problems through the transfers of structured knowledge in the form of memes learned from previous problem-solving experiences, to enhance future evolutionary searches. In particular, the proposed memetic search paradigm is composed of four culture-inspired operators, namely, Meme Learning, Meme Selection, Meme Variation and Meme Imitation. The learning operator mines for memes in the form of latent structures derived from past experiences of problem-solving. The selection operator identifies the fit memes that replicate and transmit across problems, while the variation operator introduces innovations into the memes. The imitation operator, on the other hand, defines how fit memes assimilate into the search process of newly encountered problems, thus gearing towards efficient and effective evolutionary optimization. Finally, comprehensive studies on two widely studied challenging well established NP-hard routing problem \u2026",

The behavior of parallel memetic algorithms in such environment is poorly understood: the vast majority of current parallel MAs assumes homogeneous environment. To deal with the heterogeneity of the computing resources, a hierarchical model PMA (hPMA-DLS) is proposed to provide the speed-up regardless of the heterogeneity in the distributed environment while preserving the standard behavior of the PMA.

We establish rigorous theoretical foundations for FedRLHF, providing convergence guarantees, and deriving sample complexity bounds that scale efficiently with the number of clients.

The framework models a population of agents which change their messaging strategies due to evolutionary updates following a Universal Darwinism approach, interact via messages, influence each other's beliefs through dynamics based on a contagion model, and maintain their beliefs through cognitive Lamarckian inheritance. Initial experiments with an abstract implementation of Digico show that: a) when AIs have faster messaging, evolution, and more influence in the recommendation algorithm, they get 80% to 95% of the views, depending on the size of the influence benefit; b) AIs designed for propaganda can typically convince 50% of humans to adopt extreme beliefs, and up to 85% when agents believe only a limited number of channels; c) a penalty for content that violates agents' beliefs reduces propaganda effectiveness by up to 8%.

During training, it relies heavily on the average magnitude of view-space positional gradients to grow Gaussians to reduce rendering loss. However, this average operation smooths the positional gradients from different viewpoints and rendering errors from different pixels, hindering the growth and optimization of many defective Gaussians. This leads to strong spurious artifacts in some areas. To address this problem, we propose Hard Gaussian Splatting, dubbed HGS, which considers multi-view significant positional gradients and rendering errors to grow hard Gaussians that fill the gaps of classical Gaussian Splatting on 3D scenes, thus achieving superior NVS results. In detail, we present positional gradient driven HGS, which leverages multi-view significant positional gradients to uncover hard Gaussians. Moreover, we propose rendering error guided HGS, which identifies noticeable pixel rendering errors and potentially over-large Gaussians to jointly mine hard Gaussians. By growing and optimizing these hard Gaussians, our method helps to resolve blurring and needle-like artifacts. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while maintaining real-time efficiency.",

As such, we propose a novel Multitask Reflective Large Language Model for Privacy-preserving Next POI Recommendation (MRP-LLM), aiming to exploit LLMs for better next POI recommendation while preserving user privacy. Specifically, the Multitask Reflective Preference Extraction Module first utilizes LLMs to distill each user's fine-grained (i.e., categorical, temporal, and spatial) preferences into a knowledge base (KB). The Neighbor Preference Retrieval Module retrieves and summarizes the preferences of similar users from the KB to obtain collaborative signals. Subsequently, aggregating the user's preferences with those of similar users, the Multitask Next POI Recommendation Module generates the next POI recommendations via multitask prompting. Meanwhile, during data collection, a Privacy Transmission Module is specifically devised to preserve sensitive POI data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed MRP-LLM in providing more accurate next POI recommendations with user privacy preserved.",

This research explored 20 university students' interaction with GAI during programming.

To analyse the data, we developed an AI-augmented thinking coding scheme with four dimensions: Question Formulation, Solution Development, Solution Analysis and Evaluation, and Solution Refinement. Participants were categorised into human-led and AI-led groups based on the time ratio of human-generating source code versus copying source code from GAI. T-tests indicated that the human-led group spent significantly more time on Solution Development and Solution Refinement than the AI-led group. Sequential pattern mining revealed distinct patterns of the two groups: the human-led group often refined GAI outputs, while the AI-led group frequently relied on direct answers from GAI. Correlation analyses found that positive attitudes towards AI, critical thinking, and programming self-efficacy positively correlated with Question Formulation; critical thinking was positively related to Solution Refinement; and programming self-efficacy was negatively associated with Solution Analysis and Evaluation.

        "abstract": "Despite remarkable achievements in deep learning across various domains, its inherent vulnerability to adversarial examples still remains a critical concern for practical deployment. Adversarial training has emerged as one of the most effective defensive techniques for improving model robustness against such malicious inputs. However, existing adversarial training schemes often lead to limited generalization ability against underlying adversaries with diversity due to their overreliance on a point-by-point augmentation strategy by mapping each clean example to its adversarial counterpart during training. In addition, adversarial examples can induce significant disruptions in the statistical information w.r.t. the target model, thereby introducing substantial uncertainty and challenges to modeling the distribution of adversarial examples. To circumvent these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware distributional adversarial training method, which enforces adversary modeling by leveraging both the statistical information of adversarial examples and its corresponding uncertainty estimation, with the goal of augmenting the diversity of adversaries. Considering the potentially negative impact induced by aligning adversaries to misclassified clean examples, we also refine the alignment reference based on the statistical proximity to clean examples during adversarial training, thereby reframing adversarial training within a distribution-to-distribution matching framework interacted between the clean and adversarial domains. Furthermore, we design an introspective gradient alignment approach via matching input gradients between these \u2026",

        "abstract": "Due to privacy and security concerns, recent advancements in group fairness advocate for model training regardless of demographic information. However, most methods still require prior knowledge of demographics. In this study, we explore the potential for achieving fairness without compromising its utility when no prior demographics are provided to the training set, namely \\emph{harmless Rawlsian fairness}. We ascertain that such a fairness requirement with no prior demographic information essential promotes training losses to exhibit a Dirac delta distribution. To this end, we propose a simple but effective method named VFair to minimize the variance of training losses inside the optimal set of empirical losses. This problem is then optimized by a tailored dynamic update approach that operates in both loss and gradient dimensions, directing the model towards relatively fairer solutions while preserving its intact utility. Our experimental findings indicate that regression tasks, which are relatively unexplored from literature, can achieve significant fairness improvement through VFair regardless of any prior, whereas classification tasks usually do not because of their quantized utility measurements. The implementation of our method is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/wxqpxw/VFair}.",

This work addresses an emerging and significant extension of the electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP), namely EVRP with time windows, simultaneous pickup-delivery, and partial recharges (EVRP-TW-SPD), which has wide real-world applications. We propose a hybrid memetic algorithm (HMA) for solving EVRP-TW-SPD. HMA incorporates two novel components: a parallel-sequential station insertion procedure for handling partial recharges that can better avoid local optima compared to purely sequential insertion, and a cross-domain neighborhood search that explores solution spaces of both electric and non-electric problem domains simultaneously. These components can also be easily applied to various EVRP variants. To bridge the gap between existing benchmarks and real-world scenarios, we introduce a new, large-scale EVRP-TW-SPD benchmark set derived from real-world applications, containing instances with many more customers and charging stations than existing benchmark instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant performance advantages of HMA over existing algorithms across a wide range of problem instances. Both the benchmark set and HMA will be open-sourced to facilitate further research in this area.",

Due to data heterogeneity, negative transfer may occur in the FL training process. This necessitates FL-PT selection based on their data complementarity. In cross-silo FL, organizations that engage in business activities are key sources of FL-PTs. The resulting FL ecosystem has two features: (i) self-interest, and (ii) competition among FL-PTs. This requires the desirable FL-PT selection strategy to simultaneously mitigate the problems of free riders and conflicts of interest among competitors. To this end, we propose an optimal FL collaboration formation strategy -- FedEgoists -- which ensures that: (1) a FL-PT can benefit from FL if and only if it benefits the FL ecosystem, and (2) a FL-PT will not contribute to its competitors or their supporters. It provides an efficient clustering solution to group FL-PTs into coalitions, ensuring that within each coalition, FL-PTs share the same interest. We theoretically prove that the FL-PT coalitions formed are optimal since no coalitions can collaborate together to improve the utility of any of their members. Extensive experiments on widely adopted benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedEgoists compared to nine state-of-the-art baseline methods, and its ability to establish efficient collaborative networks in cross-silos FL with FL-PTs that engage in business activities.",

In contrast to existing learning-based methods, the proposed RSRL is inspired by both error-correction codec and structural biology. Specifically, RSRL first learns the representations for the subsequent storage from the binary data transformed by the Reed-Solomon codec. Then, the representations are masked by an RS-code-informed mask to focus on correcting the burst errors occurring in the learning process. With the decoded representations with error corrections, a novel biologically stabilized loss is formulated to regularize the data representations to possess stable single-stranded structures. By incorporating these novel strategies, the proposed RSRL can learn highly durable, dense, and lossless representations for the subsequent storage tasks into DNA sequences. The proposed RSRL has been compared with a number of strong baselines in real-world tasks of multi-modal data storage. The experimental results obtained demonstrate that RSRL can store diverse types of data with much higher information density and durability but much lower error rates.",

Designing a specialized optimizer for each of these problems is challenging, typically requiring significant domain knowledge and human efforts. Hence, developing general-purpose optimizers as an off-the-shelf tool for a wide range of problems has been a long-standing research target. This article introduces MEGO, a novel general-purpose neural optimizer trained through a fully data-driven learning-to-optimize (L2O) approach. MEGO consists of a mixture-of-experts trained on experiences from solving training problems and can be viewed as a foundation model for optimization problems with binary decision variables. When presented with a problem to solve, MEGO actively selects relevant expert models to generate high-quality solutions. MEGO can be used as a standalone sample-efficient optimizer or in conjunction with existing search methods as an initial solution generator. The generality of MEGO is validated across six problem classes, including three classic problem classes and three problem classes arising from real-world applications in compilers, network analysis, and 3D reconstruction. Trained solely on classic problem classes, MEGO performs very well on all six problem classes, significantly surpassing widely used general-purpose optimizers in both solution quality and efficiency. In some cases, MEGO even surpasses specialized state-of-the-art optimizers. Additionally, MEGO provides a similarity measure between problems, yielding a new perspective for problem classification.

However, most SBRSs primarily maximize recommendation accuracy but ignore user minor preferences, thus leading to filter bubbles in the long run. Only a handful of works, being devoted to improving diversity, depend on unique model designs and calibrated loss functions, which cannot be easily adapted to existing accuracy-oriented SBRSs. It is thus worthwhile to come up with a simple yet effective design that can be used as a plugin to facilitate existing SBRSs on generating a more diversified list in the meantime preserving the recommendation accuracy. In this case, we propose an end-to-end framework applied for every existing representative (accuracy-oriented) SBRS, called diversified category-aware attentive SBRS (DCA-SBRS), to boost the performance on recommendation diversity. It consists of two novel designs: a model-agnostic diversity-oriented loss function, and a non-invasive category-aware attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on three datasets showcase that our framework helps existing SBRSs achieve extraordinary performance in terms of recommendation diversity and comprehensive performance, without significantly deteriorating recommendation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art accuracy-oriented SBRSs.",

        "abstract": "Video-based facial analysis is important for autonomous agents to understand human expressions and sentiments. However, limited labeled data is available to learn effective facial representations. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised face-centric pretraining framework, called PrefAce, which learns transferable video facial representation without labels. The self-supervised learning is performed with an effective landmark-guided global-local tube distillation. Meanwhile, a novel instance-wise update FaceFeat Cache is built to enforce more discriminative and diverse representations for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework learns universal instance-aware facial representations with fine-grained landmark details from videos. The point is that it can transfer across various facial analysis tasks, eg, Facial Attribute Recognition (FAR), Facial Expression Recognition (FER), DeepFake Detection (DFD), and Lip Synchronization (LS). Our framework also outperforms the state-of-the-art on various downstream tasks, even in low data regimes. Code is available at https://github. com/siyuan-h/PrefAce.",

This is especially useful in multiobjective optimization settings where a set of tradeoff solutions is sought under tight evaluation budgets. In this article, we introduce a novel concept of inverse transfer in multiobjective optimization. Inverse transfer stands out by employing Bayesian inverse Gaussian process models to map performance vectors in the objective space to population search distributions in task-specific decision space, facilitating knowledge transfer through objective space unification. Building upon this idea, we introduce the first Inverse Transfer Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimizer (invTrEMO).

        "abstract": "Online continual learning (OCL) aims to continuously learn new data from a single pass over the online data stream. It generally suffers from the catastrophic forgetting issue. Existing replay-based methods effectively alleviate this issue by replaying part of old data in a proxy-based or contrastive-based replay manner. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of these two replay manners and find they can be complementary. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel replay-based method called proxy-based contrastive replay (PCR), which replaces anchor-to-sample pairs with anchor-to-proxy pairs in the contrastive-based loss to alleviate the phenomenon of forgetting. Based on PCR, we further develop a more advanced method named holistic proxy-based contrastive replay (HPCR), which consists of three components. The contrastive component conditionally incorporates anchor-to-sample pairs to PCR, learning more fine-grained semantic information with a large training batch. The second is a temperature component that decouples the temperature coefficient into two parts based on their impacts on the gradient and sets different values for them to learn more novel knowledge. The third is a distillation component that constrains the learning process to keep more historical knowledge. Experiments on four datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of HPCR over various state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Markov Decision Process (MDP) presents a mathematical framework to formulate the learning processes of agents in reinforcement learning. MDP is limited by the Markovian assumption that a reward only depends on the immediate state and action. However, a reward sometimes depends on the history of states and actions, which may result in the decision process in a non-Markovian environment. In such environments, agents receive rewards via temporally-extended behaviors sparsely, and the learned policies may be similar. This leads the agents acquired with similar policies generally overfit to the given task and can not quickly adapt to perturbations of environments. To resolve this problem, this paper tries to learn the diverse policies from the history of state-action pairs under a non-Markovian environment, in which a policy dispersion scheme is designed for seeking diverse policy representation. Specifically, we first adopt a transformer-based method to learn policy embeddings. Then, we stack the policy embeddings to construct a dispersion matrix to induce a set of diverse policies. Finally, we prove that if the dispersion matrix is positive definite, the dispersed embeddings can effectively enlarge the disagreements across policies, yielding a diverse expression for the original policy embedding distribution. Experimental results show that this dispersion scheme can obtain more expressive diverse policies, which then derive more robust performance than recent learning baselines under various learning environments.",

However, in reality, data usually reside in distributed parties such as different institutions and may not be directly gathered and integrated due to various data policy constraints. As a result, some parties may suffer from insufficient data available for training machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a multi-party dual learning (MPDL) framework to alleviate the problem of limited data with poor quality in an isolated party. Since the knowledge sharing processes for multiple parties always emerge in dual forms, we show that dual learning is naturally suitable to handle the challenge of missing data, and explicitly exploits the probabilistic correlation and structural relationship between dual tasks to regularize the training process. We introduce a feature-oriented differential privacy with mathematical proof, in order to avoid possible privacy leakage of raw features in the dual inference process. The approach requires minimal modifications to the existing multi-party learning structure, and each party can build flexible and powerful models separately, whose accuracy is no less than non-distributed self-learning approaches. The MPDL framework achieves significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art multi-party learning methods, as we demonstrated through simulations on real-world datasets.",

Existing studies usually assume that the learned new feature representation is \\emph{domain-invariant}, and thus train a transfer model  on the source domain. In this paper, we consider a more realistic scenario where the new feature representation is suboptimal and small divergence still exists across domains. We propose a new transfer model called Randomized Transferable Machine (RTM) to handle such small divergence of domains. Specifically, we work on the new source and target data learned from existing feature-based transfer methods. The key idea is to enlarge source training data populations by randomly corrupting the new source data using some noises, and then train a transfer model  that performs well on all the corrupted source data populations. In principle, the more corruptions are made, the higher the probability of the new target data can be covered by the constructed source data populations, and thus better transfer performance can be achieved by . An ideal case is with infinite corruptions, which however is infeasible in reality. We develop a marginalized solution that enables to train an  without conducting any corruption but equivalent to be trained using infinite source noisy data populations. We further propose two instantiations of , which theoretically show the transfer superiority over the conventional transfer model . More importantly, both instantiations have closed-form solutions, leading to a fast and efficient training process.

To this end, this article studies new scalable GP paradigms including the non-stationary heteroscedastic GP, the mixture of GPs and the latent GP, which introduce additional latent variables to modulate the outputs or inputs in order to learn richer, non-Gaussian statistical representation. We further resort to different variational inference strategies to arrive at analytical or tighter evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) of the marginal likelihood for efficient and effective model training. Extensive numerical experiments against state-of-the-art GP and neural network (NN) counterparts on various tasks verify the superiority of these scalable modulated GPs, especially the scalable latent GP, for learning diverse data distributions.",

A number of approaches have been proposed to accomplish it, utilizing edges, vertex features, or both aforementioned. However, few of them consider how the quantification of dichotomous inclination w.r.t. network topology and vertex features may influence vertex-cluster preferences, which deters previous methods from uncovering more interpretable latent groups in network data. To fill this void, we propose a novel probabilistic model, dubbed Relational Thematic Clustering with Mutually Preferred Neighbors (RTCMPN). Different from prevalent approaches which predetermine the learning significance of edge structure and vertex features, RTCMPN can further learn the latent preferences indicating which neighboring vertices are more possible to be in the same cluster, and the dichotomous inclinations describing how relative significance w.r.t. edge structure and vertex features may impact the association between pairwise vertices. Therefore, cluster structure implanted with edge structure, vertex features, neighboring preferences, and vertex-vertex dichotomous inclinations can be learned by RTCMPN. We additionally derive an effective Expectation-Maximization algorithm for RTCMPN to infer the optimal model parameters. RTCMPN has been compared with several strong baselines on various network data. The remarkable results validate the effectiveness of RTCMPN.",

        "abstract": "Memetic computing is a subject in computer science which considers complex structures as the combination of simple agents, memes, whose evolutionary interactions lead to intelligent structures capable of problem-solving. This paper focuses on memetic computing optimization algorithms and proposes a counter-tendency approach for algorithmic design. Research in the field tends to go in the direction of improving existing algorithms by combining different methods or through the formulation of more complicated structures. Contrary to this trend, we instead focus on simplicity, proposing a structurally simple algorithm with emphasis on processing only one solution at a time. The proposed algorithm, namely three stage optimal memetic exploration, is composed of three memes; the first stochastic and with a long search radius, the second stochastic and with a moderate search radius and the third deterministic and with a short search radius. The bottom-up combination of the three operators by means of a natural trial and error logic, generates a robust and efficient optimizer, capable of competing with modern complex and computationally expensive algorithms. This is suggestive of the fact that complexity in algorithmic structures can be unnecessary, if not detrimental, and that simple bottom-up approaches are likely to be competitive is here invoked as an extension to memetic computing basing on the philosophical concept of Ockham\u2019s Razor. An extensive experimental setup on various test problems and one digital signal processing application is presented. Numerical results show that the proposed approach, despite its simplicity and low \u2026",

        "abstract": "Key to inducing adaptive immune responses is TCR recognition of HLA/peptide complexes, following HLA binding of the antigenic peptides. Numerous sequence-and structure-based predictors have been devised with regard to the recognition and the binding problem. The structure-based ones, however, are often not suited for high-throughput screenings of the greatly polymorphic immunogenic repertoire. It is then necessary to harvest simple yet discriminative structure-based features to be utilized prior to or in conjunction with some structure-based computational methods to help narrow down the search space. In this paper, bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles of the nonameric antigenic peptides bound by the HLA-A*0201 molecule are studied. Some consistent patterns were observed for \u03d5 and \u03c8 torsions indicating that an antigenic peptide\u2014already bound by the HLA\u2014may be further recognized by \u2026",

        "abstract": "The title of data scientist has been described as one of the sexiest jobs of the 21st century. Numerous efforts have been made to define the job of a data scientist in a qualitative manner by, for example, listing the job functions and required skill sets of data scientists. However, to the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to define the term data scientist in a scientific manner. In this paper, we address this issue by using a data-driven approach to answer three questions: 1) What is a proper definition of the term data scientist from a market-demand perspective? 2) Do self-described data scientists meet the market demand? and 3) Finally, how can companies efficiently recruit data scientists that match their openings? To answer these questions, we crawl two data sets for the supply and demand sides. For the former, we collect a set of data scientist user profiles from LinkedIn; for the latter, we collect a set of \u2026",

        "abstract": "Sample-based evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are widely used for optimizing problems with multi (greater than one but less than four) or even many (greater than or equal to four) objectives of interest. In general, the difficulty of a problem exponentially increases with the number of objectives, serving as a clear example of the curse of dimensionality. The exploratory approach an EA takes in these cases has led to it being thought of as a big data generator, progressively sampling and evaluating solutions in high performing regions of a decision space to guide the search towards optimal solutions. Notably, in both multi-and many-objective EAs, the data samples can be further utilized for building inverse models, mapping points in objective space back to solutions in the decision space. Such models offer immense flexibility to a decision maker in generating new target solutions on the fly, thereby facilitating real-time a posteriori preference incorporation. In this paper, we show that the data generated from a many-objective optimization search is in fact more conducive to inverse modeling than its multi-objective counterpart (where the output space is compressed via synthetic objective aggregation)\u2013highlighting a rare blessing of dimensionality that has yet to be explored in the context of optimization. We first present simple theoretical arguments supporting this statement. Thereafter, experimental studies of Gaussian process-based inverse modeling for a pedagogical and a practical composite manufacturing example are carried out to further confirm the theory.",

For linear evaluation on other datasets (ImageNet, Places205, and iNaturalist18), we train linear models with SGD using a batch size of 256, a learning rate of 0.01 decayed by 0.1 at three equally spaced intervals, a momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 0.0001.
